# To Read
* One goal of a subnet is to split a large network into a grouping of smaller, interconnected networks to help minimize traffic
* IP Address has Network Portion & Host Portion
* Networks can be logically broken down into smaller networks which is known as subnetting
* A subnet is a logical subdivision of an IP network
* The process of dividing a network into two or more networks is called subnetting
* IP whitelisting is when you grant network access only to specific IP addresses

# Usage / Purpose
* subnetting helps to relieve the network congestion
* subnetting help to improve the network performance

# Terminology
* Subnet = Subnet is a range of IP address in the Virtual Network
* Subnetwork = A subnetwork or subnet is a logical subdivision of an IP network
* VDI = Virtual Desktop Infrastructure 
* Subnet Mask = A subnet mask is a 32-bit number created by setting host bits to all 0s and setting network bits to all 1s
* IP Address Classes = Class A: 255.0.0.0 , Class B: 255.255.0.0 , Class C: 255.255.255.0
* Subnetting = 
* IP Address = Network Portion + Host Portion

# Commands
* $ testnet
* $ telnet <address> <port> = used to create a remote connection with a system over a TCP/IP network

# Protocols
* HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP, POP3, and IMAP protocols
